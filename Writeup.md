# Abstract

The goal of this project is to Diagnose plant disease by Building a classification system with deep learning models.

# Design

Build a system that can help farmers to diagnose plant disease by deep learning models.

# Data

The dataset is images data include three classes: Healthy plant, Early blight plant and late blight plant.

# Algorithms

- Keras

# Tools
 
- Python Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib, panda, tensorflow


# Communication

After testing our model this figure show how we got a perfect accuracy.
